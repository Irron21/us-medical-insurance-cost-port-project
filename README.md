# us-medical-insurance-cost-data-analysis

## A functional project made to investigate findings in the given dataset of the US Medical Insurance Cost.

This is a [course portfolio starter project](https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/portfolio-project-python-project/1908) that was built in [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) document using visual studio code as the code editor. Every function in this project are developed to perform different calculation to show result of different ideas for analyzation of the [given dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Irron21/us-medical-insurance-cost-data-analysis/main/python-portfolio-project-starter-files/insurance.csv).

### The procedures that I have done to construct this project:
1. Extract the content of the [insurance.csv](https://github.com/Irron21/us-medical-insurance-cost-data-analysis/blob/main/python-portfolio-project-starter-files/insurance.csv) file
2. Iterate through every row of the dataset then assign it as a value of each unique key ID
3. Iterate through every value of each key to pass it as a parameter to each function
4. Construct different functions to make calculations within the scope of the analysis idea, thus, giving us its findings

### Summary of targets and findings:
