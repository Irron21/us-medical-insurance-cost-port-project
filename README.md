# us-medical-insurance-cost-data-analysis

## A functional project made to investigate findings in the given dataset of the US Medical Insurance Cost.

This is a [course portfolio starter project](https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/portfolio-project-python-project/1908) that was built in [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) document using visual studio code as the code editor. Every function in this project are developed to perform different calculation to show result of different ideas for analyzation of the [given dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Irron21/us-medical-insurance-cost-data-analysis/main/python-portfolio-project-starter-files/insurance.csv).

### The procedures that I have done to construct this project:
1. Extract the content of the [insurance.csv](https://github.com/Irron21/us-medical-insurance-cost-data-analysis/blob/main/python-portfolio-project-starter-files/insurance.csv) file
2. Iterate through every row of the dataset then assign it as a value of each unique key ID
3. Iterate through every value of each key to pass it as a parameter to each function
4. Construct different functions to make calculations within the scope of the analysis idea, thus, giving us its findings

### Summary of targets and findings:
**Q:** Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset. <br>
**A:** The average age in the dataset is: 39

**Q:** Find out the average bmi of the patients in the dataset. <br>
**A:** The average bmi in the dataset is: 30.66

**Q:** Count the frequency of each region that appeared in the dataset. <br>
**A:** southwest: 325 | southeast: 364 | northwest: 325 | northeast: 324

**Q:** Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from. <br>
**A:** The majority of the individuals are from southeast with the count of 364.

**Q:** The sum of charges for both smokers and non-smokers. <br>
**A:** smoker: $8764878.59784, non-smoker: $8972335.916618997

**Q:** The sum of charges for both smokers and non-smokers and its difference to each other. <br>
**A:** smoker: $8764878.60, non-smoker: $8972335.92 | The difference cost between a smoker and a non-smoker is: $207457.32

**Q:** Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset. <br>
**A:** 39 is the average age for individuals that has atleast 1 children
